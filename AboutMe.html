        <p>
          I started off as a blank slate, like most of this page. As time progressed, I started to add some knowledge and color to my life - which formed a picture. That picture is me today.  Tomorrow I'll be a little different, since another day will have been added to the canvas that is me.

        Well, I went to New Orleans, the land of vampires at which point I insisted one take a photo with me - why becaue I'm that vain that I knew the holiday was about me, yes, Halloween was all about me.  I'm so vain, that I think the holiday was about me... </p>
